# 🚀 Mini-Projects

Welcome to my **Mini-Projects** repository!  
This collection showcases small but powerful applications built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Each project demonstrates practical use-cases and hands-on knowledge of full-stack development.

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data
- **Express.js** – Backend framework for building RESTful APIs
- **React.js** – Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side logic
